Hi, I'm a third year PhD student in Department of Epidemiology at UCLA, with a interest in the intersection of bioinformatics and epidemiology, especially investigating the complex interplay between environmental toxicants and Parkinson's Disease through the integration of environmental exposure and multi-omics approaches (e.g., epigenomics and metabolomics). I'm currently working closely with Dr. Beate Ritz.
